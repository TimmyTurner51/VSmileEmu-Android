# VSmileEmu-Android
An experimental VSmile emulator written by AI, vibe coded, built for Android!

Credits to sp1187. Their code was used to make this app. It was an excellent candidate.

I got near-constant 60-61 FPS while testing on Redmagic 10 Pro. It's likely it'll work relatively well on other Android devices too. 

Enjoy another way to play VSmile games on the go!

First-time Setup:
- Select (or make) a folder in which the emulator will use.
- The emulator will create folders in that folder:
    bios
    roms
    saves
    screemshots
- Place your legally obtained bios in the bios folder, name it vsmile_bios.bin
- Place your legally obtained roms in the roms folder. They can be any name, but they must end in .bin format.
