# VSmileEmu-Android
An experimental VSmile emulator written by AI, vibe coded, built for Android!

Credits to sp1187. Their code was used to make this app. It was an excellent candidate.

I got near-constant 60-61 FPS while testing on Redmagic 10 Pro. It's likely it'll work relatively well on other Android devices too. 
In the future, the emulation overlay will be cleaned up, and settings for touch overlay is planned.

v0.1: Experimental, Initial Release:

Expect bugs. There is known audio issues. This will be fixed.

- Modern-style GUI/UIs. 
- Emulation folder setup greetings.
- Basic app settings.
- ROM menu.
- Emulation Settings available while in-game.
